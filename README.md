## ðŸ“¸ Instagram Profile & Activity Scraper

This project is a **Streamlit web app** that automates the process of scraping profile and activity data from Instagram using **Selenium + undetected-chromedriver**.  

It logs into Instagram (via cookies or credentials), navigates through the profile, followers, following, recent posts, and "Your Activity" sections, and captures screenshots for analysis.
